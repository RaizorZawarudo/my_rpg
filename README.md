# my_rpg
Simple RPG game entirely built using CSFML library. Standard lib C is not allowed for the project.
The game includes an ingame menu, quest menu, inventory and player stats menu. Items can be used , equipped, or thrown. Quests can be abandonned.
All ennemys, npcs, items and quests are loaded through a csv file system that was designed personally. The csv parser was also home-made.
This allows "would-be map-creators" to create a complete new game without ever touching the source code.
This was a group project.
